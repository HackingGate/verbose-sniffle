iOS Test

## Prerequisites

The project is tested on Xcode 14.2.0 and Xcode 14.3.1.

## Installation

To run the app, select PictureViewer and an iOS Simulator 16.2 or above.

## Configuration

Configuration is not required. You are free to use the Flicker API key hard-coded in the project for testing purpose. It's not a good practice as the key is included in git commit history.

## Acknowledgment

This project uses Kingfisher to display and cache images, Realm for image data persistence.
